			+ "But officials are worried the dolphin is seeking close contact with swimmers.\r\n"
			+ "Mayor Roger Lars said a number of bathers had been scared.\r\n"
			+ "\"I issued this ban to protect people's security,\" said the mayor of LandÃ©vennec.\r\n"
			+ "The 3m (10ft) dolphin had initially delighted locals, swimming with water sports enthusiasts in Brest harbour, but it had since moved south to his village of 300 people.\r\n"
			+ "According to Le Telegramme website, the dolphin had not been aggressive but had rubbed up against boats and swimmers alike, even in shallow waters.\r\n"
			+ "Last month a swimmer had to be rescued by a boat when the dolphin stopped her returning to the shore, it reported.\r\n"
			+ "A kayaker said the dolphin had leapt over his head and a Spanish holidaymaker had complained after being \"confronted by the dolphin, which was anxious to interact\".\r\n"
			+ "The last straw appeared to come last week when the dolphin tossed a young woman bather in the air with its nose.\r\n"
			+ "The mayor said swimming and diving would be banned wherever the dolphin's presence was confirmed, as well as approaching within 50m of the animal.\r\n"
			+ "A specialist at a Brest aquarium said there was a risk that the dolphin could cause unintentional harm with its tail fin.\r\n"
			+ "However, Breton lawyer Erwan Le Cornec denounced the restrictions as over the top. \"How many accidents have there been with a dolphin in FinistÃ¨re since our two species existed? None,\" he complained.";
